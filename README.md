# Whack-a-Mole Game

Welcome to the Whack-a-Mole game repository! This project is a basic implementation of the classic Whack-a-Mole game built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. The project was bootstrapped using Vitejs.
Although this is an intial commit. I would like to make the user experience better with some more features

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/whack-a-mole.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd whack-a-mole`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the ReactJS application.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitejs

## Learning Experience

My first time working with Tailwind CSS. For the most part it required me to constantly refer to its documentation. Although, having experience in native CSS, inline styling, and previous knowledge of tools like Sass helped a TON. Other learning outcomes were tackling the asynchronous nature of the `useState` hook and learning more about cleanup functions in React.
